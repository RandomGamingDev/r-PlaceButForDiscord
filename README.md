# r-PlaceButForDiscord
r/Place but different, and for Discord! 
It's basically r/Place, but for Discord!
The grid for this is 100x100 and there is no time delay
To start placing enter !place x y r g b, where x and y are the coordinates and rgb is for the color.

Note: After compiling just include 2 files, token.txt, which should contain your bot token, and place.img, which should be a 100x100 image
